# dungeon_adventure notes

This is a mini game to implement object orientation concept. To start we need to create a model for our game:

* Dungeon: This will be our main class that encapsulates the entire program.
* Player: The player is the link between the user and the dungeon. The player will move between rooms in the dungeon.
* Rooms: The rooms of the dungeon are the locations where the player can move through.
